Notebook editor
===============

Write a program that reads the `json` data of an jupyter notebook and edits it in one of the following ways:

  - select only the markdown cells
  - select only the code cells
  - deletes all the outputs
  - write out to edited notebook as json again
  - create a standalone script that can be run from the command line
